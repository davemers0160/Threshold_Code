# Threshold_Code
Basic code for trying out different binary threshold algorithms for image processing

Added a non-binary threshold that could be run into a secondary thresholding algorithm.

the image is a good use case because it is not uniform in contrast and shows the failings of most thresholding algorithms.

A better approach may be to block threshold with an overlap, then stitch the blocks back together at the end.
